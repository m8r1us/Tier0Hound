# Tier 0 Hound Dashboard

The dashboard is part of the following article [Credential Tiering - The Value of Containment Part 2](https://www.scip.ch/?labs.20231214) and requires a BloodHound FOSS or BloodHound CE dataset.

To use the dashboard, get the [NeoDash](https://neo4j.com/labs/neodash/) application and import the dashboard `Tier0HoundDashboard.json`. NeoDash can be downloaded through the Neo4j Desktop application from the [graph app gallery](https://install.graphapp.io/) or directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neodash). NeoDash works also with the Neo4j Community Edition.
